A tool for alerting when desired gear appears on the Splatnet App store.
Requires an iksm token (same one as used for squidtracks), which can be retrieved by following eli's instructions at https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink/wiki/mitmproxy-instructions
If a discord token and user ID are provided, it will sent a DM to the user ID from the token's bot account if any gear is found. This script can be put into a crontab file to run every hour and send you a DM when any desired gear 
appears.
